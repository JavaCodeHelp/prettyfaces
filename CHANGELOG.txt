------------------------------------
           VERSION 3.1.0
------------------------------------

Features & Enhancements:

* Introducing: URL mapping configuration with annotations (http://ocpsoft.com/prettyfaces/annotations-support-is-coming-to-prettyfaces-url-rewriting/ + http://ocpsoft.com/docs/prettyfaces/snapshot/en-US/html/Configuration.html#config.annotations)
