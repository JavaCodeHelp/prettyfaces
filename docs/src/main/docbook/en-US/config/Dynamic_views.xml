	<title>* Dynamic view-IDs (DynaView)</title>
	<para>
		Dynamic view-IDs (referred to as DynaView) allow us to determine (at the time the page is 
		requested) the page our users should see for a given URL-mapping pattern.
		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[<url-mapping id="home">
	<pattern value="/home/" />
	<view-id value="#{bean.getViewPath}" />
</url-mapping>
		]]></programlisting>
		
		Notice that we've used an EL method-expression where we would normally have specified a view-ID.
		PrettyFaces will invoke this method-expression, and use the result of the method as a final URL
		to be displayed by the server. In a sense, we're asking the system to figure out which page to
		display, and telling it that it can get the answer by calling our method:
		
		<programlisting>@Named("bean")
@RequestScoped
public class HomeBean {
	
	@Inject CurrentUser user;
	
	public String getViewPath() {
		if ( user.isLoggedIn() )
		{
			return "/faces/home/home.jsf";
		}
		
		return "/faces/login.jsf";
	}
}</programlisting>

		Here, our method <code>#{bean.getViewPath}</code> is going to check the current user's logged-in
		status, display the home page if he/she is logged in, or display the login page if they are not.

	<caution>
		<para>
 			Automatic <link linkend="Outbound_rewriting">out-bound URL-rewriting</link> will not function
 			on pages with dynamic view-ID's.
