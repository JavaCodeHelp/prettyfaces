	<title>Create your first bookmarkable URL (mapping a URL)</title>
	<para>
		The URL mapping element is the core configuration element for PrettyFaces
		most applications. Let's consider, for instance, that we are building a web-store and we want
		our users to access the store at the URL <code>/store/</code> - we only need the most basic
		features of the URL-mapping to achieve this.

      <programlisting><![CDATA[<url-mapping id="store"> 
   <pattern value="/store/" /> 
   <view-id value="/faces/shop/store.jsf" />
</url-mapping>]]></programlisting>
	
		With these two simple lines of configuration, the user sees: <code>pattern="/store/"</code> 
		in the browser URL and in the output HTML, but the server is actually rendering the resource: 
		<code>/faces/shop/store.jsf</code> (the actual location of the page on the server.)
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Ignore the <code>id="store"</code> attribute for now, we'll cover that under
		<link linkend="navigation"> navigation</link>. Which is useful when redirecting a user between
		different pages in your application.
	</para>
